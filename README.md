# Awards Submission Prototype

The prototyping team within Digital Science are currently investigating and looking into ways of better supporting awarding 
bodies and academic institutions who bestow awards to individuals and groups of people to acknowledge them among their peers 
and the wider global community. At current, there are very limited options to support this process in a way that makes the 
resulting award data discoverable, reusable, verifiable and ensure longevity on the Internet.

We have begun developing a prototype application of what such a system may look like. It is currently in the early stages 
of ideation and iteration. Very early on we decided to build our prototype using the open-source Pubsweet platform/framework.
